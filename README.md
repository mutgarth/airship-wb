# wab_app

Simple and intuitive app to perform specific calculations regarding the airship adb-3-3. 

The class airship.dart was not included in the repo since the file contains sensitive data of the airship project.

I made this app aiming to learn more about software archtecture and get some experience with app development. 

In my opinion, the most important part of the code is the Provider that provides data from the top to the bottom of the app's three.
